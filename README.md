As a Pipeline Technical Director at Technicolor India, I bridge the gap between artists and technology by developing efficient workflows and tools. I started my journey in VFX as a Prep Artist, which provided me with a strong foundation in production. My passion for technical problem-solving led me to transition into a Pipeline TD role, where my background as an artist helps me better understand and address production challenges.

In my current role, I provide technical support to artists, contribute to testing and feedback for software releases from the R&D team, and develop Python-based tools to enhance production efficiency. With experience in Linux, strong knowledge of Nuke, and familiarity with various DCC software like Houdini, Maya, Katana, and Clarisse, I am always exploring new ways to optimize workflows and improve the pipeline.
